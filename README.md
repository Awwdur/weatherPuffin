## Weather Puffin
MacOS app that gives you the weather from a zip code. Doesn't look that great currently but hey it works.

Maybe there will be a background or theme that will change depending on the
temperature.

Currently, all this app does is take your zip code and returns the temperature
from the nearest available weather station provided by Open Weather Map.
